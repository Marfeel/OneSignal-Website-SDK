branch from the **marfeel** branch, and merge into it.

this branch will be rebased with OneSignal's OneSignal-Website-SDK master

generate bundle
```sh
# generate the bundle
npm run build:prod

# move it to XP
cp ./build/bundles/OneSignalSDK.js $MARFEELXP_HOME/Tenants/vhosts/marfeel/resources/pushNotifications/OneSignalSDK.js
```

## debug

You should be able to run commands in the developer tools Console now.

Execute the following code in console:

```js
OneSignal.log.setLevel('trace');
```
You should see undefined as the result. Reloading the page will provide you all the debug call of OneSignal.

If you see:

Uncaught ReferenceError: OneSignal is not defined(â€¦) or ReferenceError: OneSignal is not defined, then OneSignal is not active on your webpage.
