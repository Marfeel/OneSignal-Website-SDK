# OneSignal Web Push SDK (mrf version)

branch from the **marfeel** branch, and merge into it.

this branch will be rebased with OneSignal's OneSignal-Website-SDK master

generate bundle
```sh
# generate the bundle
npm run build:prod

# move it to XP
cp ./build/bundles/OneSignalSDK.js $MARFEELXP_HOME/Tenants/vhosts/marfeel/resources/pushNotifications/OneSignalSDK.js
```

## debugging
Enable web SDK logging, execute the following code:
```js
OneSignal.log.setLevel('trace');
```
You should see undefined as the result.

If you see:

Uncaught ReferenceError: OneSignal is not defined(â€¦) or ReferenceError: OneSignal is not defined, then OneSignal is not active on your webpage.

You can always disable this additional logging by entering this code:
```js
OneSignal.log.setLevel('warn');
```

## checks
in chrome dev tools (remember that Push notifications do not work in incognito)

```js
OneSignal.VERSION
// it should return 150300 (defined in package.json)
```

accept push notifications and send a push notification
```js
OneSignal.sendSelfNotification(
 /* Title (defaults if unset) */ "Title",
 /* Message (defaults if unset) */ "Text",
  /* URL (defaults if unset) */ 'https://example.com/?_osp=do_not_open',
 /* Icon */ 'https://onesignal.com/images/notification_logo.png'
);
```
